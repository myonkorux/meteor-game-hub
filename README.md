meteor-game-hub

Use meteor to make a multi-device gaming hub framework. 

The framework will manage a network of devices, with one 
host and multiple players. By synchronizing the database
with the meteor framework, each player can have a personal
perspective of the game from their device, while seeing the
common view from the host device.

In addition to the hub framework, multiple modules are
included, containing game logic. The modules request information
from the framework and return information to update the database.
